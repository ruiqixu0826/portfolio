            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>Classical Chinese landscape paintings are invaluable treasures of Chinese culture, but many of the
                surviving works have been damaged or defaced due to historical events and storage issues. Despite the
                effort that artists have made to restore them through imitation, they have struggled to replicate the
                original painters' unique style due to individual painting habits. With recent advances in machine
                learning and image processing, leveraging such technologies to restore ancient Chinese landscape
                paintings has emerged as a promising solution.</p>

            <h2>Technical details</h2>
            <p>To address the challenge brought by the unique characteristics of Chinese landscape paintings, we propose
                the hierarchical painter, a multi-hierarchical inpainting model for Chinese landscape painting
                restoration. First, we design a normalization algorithm for Chinese landscape painting including
                purifying backgrounds and eliminating noise, seals, and inscriptions. Then, we separately generate
                background
                and details to ensure the restoration performance in both overall structure and detailed texture.
                Specifically, we offer distinct designs to efficiently extract the structure and obtain the segmentation
                of details. Finally, we integrate the superposition of the background and details into the original
                image by inpainting models to maintain the overall consistency of the final restored image.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content detail">
                        <p>Chinese landscape paintings share a common attribute in that their contents are grayscale,
                            and the
                            background is typically blank. However, due to technological limitations in the conservation
                            of
                            paintings during ancient times, many surviving works have backgrounds that contain unwanted
                            noise.
                            These noise artifacts can have a detrimental effect on the performance of our model. To
                            address this
                            challenge, we pre-processed the input images by reducing or eliminating irrelevant noise and
                            unifying the background color. This allowed us to achieve more accurate and precise
                            inpainting
                            results, even in the presence of challenging noise artifacts.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content detail">
                        <p>Background generation is a key component of our proposed model, as it aims to transfer the
                            style of
                            objects in the background of the imitation copy to those in the original painting. In our
                            specific
                            case, it is critical to preserve the content's structure in the background of the ZiMing
                            Scroll,
                            including the trend of mountains and rivers, while also translating the style of the
                            content, such
                            as shading, ink techniques, and stroke texture, to match the original painting's style. By
                            incorporating these factors into our background generation algorithm, we were able to
                            achieve highly
                            realistic and faithful restorations of Chinese landscape paintings.</p>

                        <p>The image-to-image translation model is effective in natural image processing but less
                            effective in
                            restoring Chinese landscape paintings due to the complex structure of foreground trees,
                            which is
                            more like a blocky entity. The current model is unable to identify each stroke separately
                            within the
                            blocks. Additional image processing and model learning are required to learn the color
                            transition
                            within trees, considering their unique characteristics.<br />

                            To address this issue, we propose a solution that includes creating a segmentation mapping
                            to
                            classify each pixel within the images and provide more information on how the color
                            transitions
                            within each stroke. Then, we employ the SPADE model to learn the color style
                            within each class and how the color transitions between classes.</p>

                        <p>To improve the integration of the generated part with the original image, we intentionally
                            inserted a
                            mask between the joined parts and applied image inpainting to fill it. This approach allows
                            the
                            generated result to consider the overall consistency with the original image rather than
                            solely
                            relying on the structure from the imitation image. <br />

                            We apply a model similar to CTSDG, which focuses on regenerating defective
                            regions within an image while preserving its overall consistency. The model first transforms
                            the
                            input image into an edge map, and then fills the corrupted part based on the edge map to
                            ensure the
                            structural correctness of the fill content. Finally, the filled edge map is added with the
                            texture
                            of the original image. After research on several edge detection methods, we change the edge
                            detection model in CTSDG from canny detection to RCF to further emphasize the structure and
                            preserve
                            some space for random generation. </p>
